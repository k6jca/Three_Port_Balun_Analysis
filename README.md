# Three_Port_Balun_Analysis
MATLAB Code to Calculate a Balun's Loss and Common-Mode Impedance

By making 9 s-parameter measurements of a 2-port balun, (using a standard 2-port VNA), a 3-port model of the balun can be created, while always maintaing a balanced load across the balun's balanced terminals.  

This code takes the 9 s-parameter measurements and creates that model.  It then calculates the s-parameters of the equivalent 2-port balun, as well as its power-loss and common-mode impedance.
